This is my personal React learning project.

Pantry Helper is a Web Application with purpose to track a household pantry/fridge inventory. It tracks expiration dates, recommends recipes from the items currently on hand, and automatically creates shopping lists based on the depleted inventory.

Primary Features to be implemented:
- Manage Pantry
  - View Inventory
    - Items Expiring Soon
  - Add/Remove item
- Shopping Lists
  - View Shopping List
- Recipes
  - Recommended Recipes
  - Browse Recipes
  - Search By Ingredient
- Settings
  - Configure Shopping List
  - Configure Recipes/Ingredients

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
